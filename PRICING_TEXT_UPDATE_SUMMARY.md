### Pricing Explanation Text:
> "Our prices are displayed in Chilean Pesos (CLP) and include consolidation and importation costs. Prices are rounded up to multiples of $500 CLP for simplicity. This ensures transparent pricing that reflects the true cost of bringing cards to Chile, including shipping, customs, and handling fees."

### Pricing Formula Details:
> "Our pricing formula considers the TCGPlayer USD price, current exchange rates, tiered markup based on card value, and daily shipping costs. Cards under $5 USD have a 90% markup, cards between $5-20 USD have a 70% markup, and cards over $20 USD have a 50% markup. All prices include a minimum of $500 CLP per card."
